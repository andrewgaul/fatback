	*** empty log message ***

	* /home/cvs/fatback/Makefile: add functionality for lex and yacc stuff

	* /home/cvs/fatback/audit.c: now uses the vars module for loglevel.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/audit.h: I dont remember what I changed! sorry.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_chain.c:
	the chain command.  it will display a cluster chain.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_cp.c:
	the cp command! this is really the heart of how fatback undeletes stuff.  it works a lot like the regular unix cp command only you give it filenames that exist withing fatback, and tell it to copy to files that exist on your real system.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_cpchain.c:
	the cpchaind command. works like the cp commaind only you give it a cluster chain and it will write it out to a file.  this is how you can store directory information

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_ls.c: the ls command. nuff said.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_misc.c:
	this holds a lot of little commands stat are to insignificant to deserve there own file.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_set.c: god: "Let there be light"
	god: "Let there be the set command"

	this is the catch-all of fatback.  the set command has its own mini-language that gives you the flexability to tweek with the programs runtime variables and such.
	there are three parts to the set command, this file, the flex lexer (setl.l), and the yacc parser (sety.y).

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_sh.c:
	the sh command.  this is essentially a version of system() that properly handles signals!!!!

	* /home/cvs/fatback/cmd_stat.c: the stat command!

	* /home/cvs/fatback/dirtree.c:
	I have no Idea what I changed in this file.  at least I'm honest.

	added entlist_t, which is used for linked lists of dirent_t *'s

	* /home/cvs/fatback/fatback.c: Now uses vars module

	* /home/cvs/fatback/fat.c: fat12 now actually works.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/fat.h: *** empty log message ***

	* /home/cvs/fatback/interface.c: major rework.
	took the command functions out and gave them there own seperate files,
	changed the way arguments get passed to commands (it now works just like a shell!),
	added some more handy functions, such as find_files()

	* /home/cvs/fatback/interface_data.c:
	initial entry.  this module holds global data that is used by the interface related portions of the program

	* /home/cvs/fatback/interface_data.h: initial entry

	* /home/cvs/fatback/interface.h:
	major rework.  see interface.c for more info

	* /home/cvs/fatback/mbr.c:
	No longer passes sector size variables around like a moron, thank god for the vars module.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/mbr.h:
	map partitions no longer needs sector size to be passed in. (horray for vars module!)

	* /home/cvs/fatback/output.c:
	Initial entry.  this module handles output simantics of writing files.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/output.h:
	Initial entry of the output handeling module for fatback

	* /home/cvs/fatback/setl.l:
	This is the lex portion of the parser of the set command language for fatback

	* /home/cvs/fatback/sety.y:
	This is the initial entry of the set module.  this is the yacc portion of the parser for the language used by the set command.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/util.c:
	fixed a problem with the errno stuff.  before it would perror and exit because errno was still set from stuff that happned a long time ago.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/util.h: *** empty log message ***

	* /home/cvs/fatback/vars.c:
	This is the initial entry of the vars module for fatback.  this module provides an excellent way of handeling global variables in a very safe mannor.  what it does is creat its own symbol table and provides functions for the rest of the program to access the variables by name.

	* /home/cvs/fatback/vars.h: initial entry of vars module

	* /home/cvs/fatback/vbr.c:
	the vbr module now uses fatback vars module for globs and therefore nolonger needs to pass around sector size variables like an ideot

	* /home/cvs/fatback/vbr.h:
	vbr module now uses fatback vars module for globals such as sectorsize. hence it no longer needs to be passed around

	* /home/cvs/fatback/mbr.c:
	First real working copy.  much has changed in this version.  their are no longer two seperate data structures, the main partition table and the list of extended partition tables have been combined to make a single master list.  a lot of functions have been renamed as well.
