Installation instructions:

in the directory where this file resides, type the following sequence of
commands:

1. './configure'
2. 'make'
3. 'make install'  (optional)

If you are compiling on a system that does not use GNU make as the default
make, then substitute 'gmake' for 'make' in the above commands.

If you encounter an error while running the commands listed above, see the file
'INSTALL' in the same directory as this file.  If problems still persist, 
contact the maintainer (listed in the file 'AUTHORS').

Building documentation:

	The Fatback manual is installed in your systems info tree upon
execution of 'make install'.  The manual is provided in Texinfo source and can
be converted into a variety of different formats.  After running the
./configure script, a Makefile will be generated that knows how to build the
documentation.  To build the documentation in dvi format (for use with xdvi or
lpr) just type 'make dvi'.   This will output a file called
'fatback-manual.dvi', which can be printed with the lpr command:
'lpr fatback-manual.dvi' or viewed in a graphical format under an X windows
environment using the Xdvi program as as follows: 'xdvi fatback-manual.dvi'. 
There is not yet support in the Makefile for all of the formats that are
supported by Texinfo, such as HTML and PostScript.  To convert the source into
HTML format, use the following command: 'makeinfo --html fatback-manual.texi'. 
This will output the file 'fatback-manual.html'
